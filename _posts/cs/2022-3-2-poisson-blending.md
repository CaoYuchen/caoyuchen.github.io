The project explores gradient-domain processing in the practice of image blending, tone mapping, and non-photorealistic rendering. The method mainly focuses on the Poisson Blending algorithm. The tasks include primary gradient minimization, 4 neighbors-based Poisson blending, mixed gradient Poisson blending, and gray-scale intensity preserved color2gray method. The whole project is implemented in Python.
