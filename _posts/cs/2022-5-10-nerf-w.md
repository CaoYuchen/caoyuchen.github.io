In this project, we explore and experiment with existing NeRF related neural network, we are interested in using NeRF to generate free view sythesized authentic photos, and especially for large real-life objects whose non-occlusive views are hard to approach, such as large architecture with occlusions and views that are too high to take a picture unless using drone.
