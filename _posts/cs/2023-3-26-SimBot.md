It's a university challenge competition organized by Amazon Alexa, which aims at building a virtual robot assistant for daily tasks by human-robot interaction(human utterance). I lead the team, designed and implemented the Alexa virtual home robot to finish housework tasks with ASR, language parser, semantic detector, RGB-D SLAM navigator, and robot instruction logic. Language model includes Transformers-based profanity, co-ref, text-to-text, and ViT vision-assisted parser.
