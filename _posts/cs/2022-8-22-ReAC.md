In this project, we experimented with 3D Lidar-based SLAM SOAT such as LOAM, Lego-LOAM, and LIO-SAM, and configured with customized Velodyne-16 and Xsens IMU, running on ground robot Husky, besides, we combined with HDL_Localization to detect and track human pedestrian nearby the robot and adjust the path planning method to follow human and avoid the obstacles. The Pipeline can run in real-time with the onboard computing units on Husky.
