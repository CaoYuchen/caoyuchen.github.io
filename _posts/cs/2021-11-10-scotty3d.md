Scotty3D is a 3D modeling software developed by CMU for education purposes, it includes tasks of Half-edge Mesh method to manage mesh editing tasks such as Edge flip, beveling, Catmull-Clark subdivision, isotropic re-mesh, linear subdivision, simplification, triangulation; it also includes path tracing methods such as camera ray intersection with objects, BVH optimization, path tracing, material tracing, direct and environment lighting rendering; At last, it includes animation of skeleton kinematics, skinning, splines, and some particle effects.
