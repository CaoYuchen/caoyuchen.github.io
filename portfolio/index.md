## Photography & Painting: 

I used to be a part-time photographer for 2 years, my main focuses are tourism-propaganda landscapes and after-processed portraits. Being a great fan of Japanese animation, I sometimes draw characters in animation. Examples are like:

## Film Screenwriting:  

I studied screenwriting courses which are led by professors from USC, this is one of my 30 mins movie script about an unofficial biography of Batman series.   

The story is set at the time when Bruce Wayne passed his golden age of being Batman. The protagonist is a normal 14 year-old kid, a fanatic hero fan but without any super power, his encounter with Batman in a crime scene dramatically changes his life...
