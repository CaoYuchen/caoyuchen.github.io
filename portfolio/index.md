# Photography & Sketch 

I used to be a part-time photographer for 2 years, my main focuses are tourism-propaganda landscapes and after-processed portraits. Being a great fan of Japanese animation, I sometimes draw characters from animation. Examples are like:

{% endcapture %}
{% include gallery images=images caption="Photos & Paintings Demo2" cols=1 %} 
</center>

# Film Screenwriting  

### Batman - The Great Normal
I studied screenwriting courses which are led by professors from USC, this is one of my 30 mins movie script about an unofficial biography of Batman series.   

The story is set at the time when Bruce Wayne passed his golden age of being Batman. The protagonist is a normal 14 year-old kid, a fanatic hero fan but without any super power, his encounter with Batman in a crime scene dramatically changes his life...

# 3D Model & Animation 

### Photo-realistic Indoor Environment

This is a realistic indoor renderning in Blender, I made it mainly for the purpose of scientific dataset generation, the rendering is real time.  

The main work includes 3D model building, accurate size, illumination, realistic camera setting, etc. You can view it below:

Derived from the real-time rendering work above, I also published the paper on <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/9/2572" target="_blank" style="color:blue">Sensors Journal</a>, the related website can be viewed at <a href="http://mpl.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/SSSBenchmark/SSS@MPL.html" target="_blank" style="color:blue">SSSBenchmark website</a>.

### Architecture 3D Modelling

I use Rhino + Grasshopper + Python to make parametric 3D models, and also I use AutoCAD + AdobeInDesign + Photoshop to create 2D visual concepts, here are some examples:

# Audio Design

I'm mostly interested in synthesized digital music, I mainly use Ableton Live to design music and sound effect for animation/movie/game purpose. Here is my music list in SoundCloud <a href="https://soundcloud.com/joshua-rain-24806913" target="_blank" style="color:blue">https://soundcloud.com/joshua-rain-24806913</a>
